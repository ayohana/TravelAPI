## Description

**A basic web API that allows users to GET and POST reviews about various travel destinations around the world.**

## User Stories

* As a user, I want to GET and POST reviews about travel destinations.
* As a user, I want to GET reviews by country or city.
* As a user, I want to see the most popular travel destinations by number of reviews or by overall rating.
* As a user, I want to PUT and DELETE reviews, but only if I wrote them. (Start by requiring a user_name param to match the user_name of the author on the message. You can always try authentication later.)
* As a user, I want to look up random destinations just for fun.
